Union and Intersection Types in TypeScript

Introduction : 
In typescript union and intersection types are used to originate or compose different of types into one its like merging types on demands.Sometimes we required multiple types and to improve the code readablity and maintablity union and intersection types are accelarating the experience so when we will need defaine our output types that may reqired multiple types and which are already stored in the code with another named variable or types.Let me provide and example of using unon and intersection types in typescript:

Union types: 
A union type you can say there types are united so we can describe the types can be anyone from the defined types.we use ('|') as a oparator to asigne multiple types into a variable like "string|number|boolean".Here the types are united and stayed together thats why we can call any of the types from them.

<!--real world example code -->

Intersection types:
Intersection types in general combined multiple types into one.its like merging different types of variable into one different entity.we use ("&") operator to composed multiple types into one eg. "BookTypes & MagazineTypes & NewsTypes"
